We designed and constructed the Wälderhaus in 2013 to showcase the amazing aspect that Hamburg is indeed a very green city. The top four levels are constructed entirely of wood, and sustainability is a key focus of the design and emplimentation. The building as well as the website is divided up into four sections: The Science Center, Workshop, Hotel and Restaurant.
