I was told proficiany in a program is only one minor part, pretty much like simply having better handwriting than anyone else. What really mattered were the ideas and stories that needed to be conveyed. In the end, it didn't matter if I scratched them out on the back of a napkin, so long as the ideas were good, nothing else mattered.

So how does one break down 17 years of work experience? I decided to rather list off what I think to be some of the most important aspects of someone working in my field.
