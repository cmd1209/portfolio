1999? No seriously. February 1999, I landed my first real job at an advertising agency in Essen, Germany. I crafted my first "Bewerbung" using Microsoft Word and persuaded my parents to shell out 100 Dollars to send me my B.F.A. portfolio with my infamous silver case. I was hired on the spot and asked if I could start the following Monday. What started that Monday in early February, 1999 set into motion one of the most amazing, terrifying, complicated and foreign work experience stories one could imaging.
