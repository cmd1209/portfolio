1999? No seriously. February 1999, I landed my first real job at an advertising agency in Essen, Germany. I crafted my first "Bewerbung" using Microsoft Word and persuaded my parents to shell out 100 Dollars to send me my <a href="http://www.marshall.edu/art/">B.F.A. Portfolio</a> with my infamous silver case. I was hired on the spot and asked if I could start the following Monday. What started that Monday in early <a href="http://together-concept.de/">early February, 1999</a> set into motion one of the most amazing, terrifying, complicated and foreign work experience stories one could imaging.

<blockquote>What comes first â€“ permission to work or permission to stay?</blockquote>

Landing a job was the easiest part of starting a career in Germany. It proved to be more difficult to be granted permission to work in Germany. I wasn't granted permission to stay in Germany without first being granted permission to work, and I wasn't granted permission to work in Germany without first being granted permission to stay. It was literally the chicken before the egg paradox.

For the following 6 years this problem was simply worked around by employers insisting that I was uniquely qualified as an American because they had future intentions of opening an office in the United States.
