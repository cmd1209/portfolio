1999? No seriously. February 1999, I landed my first real job at an advertising agency in Essen, Germany. I crafted my first "Bewerbung" using Microsoft Word and persuaded my parents to shell out 100 Dollars to send me my <a href="http://www.marshall.edu/art/">B.F.A. Portfolio</a> with my infamous silver case. I was hired on the spot and asked if I could start the following Monday. What started that Monday in <a href="http://together-concept.de/">early February, 1999</a> set into motion one of the most amazing, terrifying, complicated and foreign work experience stories one could imaging.

<blockquote>What comes first – permission to work or permission to stay?</blockquote>

Landing a job was the easiest part of starting a career in Germany. It proved to be more difficult to be granted permission to work in Germany. I wasn't granted permission to stay in Germany without first being granted permission to work, and I wasn't granted permission to work in Germany without first being granted permission to stay. It was literally the chicken before the egg paradox.

For the following six years this problem was simply worked around by employers insisting that I was uniquely qualified as an American because they had future intentions of opening an office in the United States. Six years was all it took to finally end this cycle. I received my permanent visa for Germany in 2006 and soon after that married my wife, which also solved the whole permission problem.

Early 2007 was an interesting time. For some reason Heidelberg seemed too small for someone in their early thirties, plus we were expecting our first child. We were given a chance to bust out of the small town and leave it behind for Germany’s second largest city; Hamburg.

So this is basically where i’ve been for the past 9 1/2 years. I’ve been a part of some amazing projects, worked with some amazing people, but now I’m ready for something else.
