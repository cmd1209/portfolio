In 2006 we were given the unique opportunity to completely rebrand an emerging company located in Berlin. Carl Zeiss Microscopy highly recommended us, and after the initial meetings we got straight to work on the corporate design.

<blockquote>Corporate Design is like buying a bespoken suit. You start off asking the client what kind of person he is.</blockquote>

It was at this time I learned a valuable lesson about CI / CD. My boss at the time equated it to fine tailoring and explained that it is like creating a bespoken suit. You start off by asking the client what kind of interests they have.
